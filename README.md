# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using the `$avg` operator incorrectly.
The provided code attempts to calculate the average age of users in each city, but it might fail if the 'age' field isn't correctly typed or if the aggregation pipeline is not structured correctly.

## Bug Description
The primary issue is in how the `$avg` operator is used. It expects a numeric field, but if the 'age' field is stored as a string, it will produce incorrect results. Moreover, a missing or incorrect `$match` or `$group` stage can lead to unexpected output. 

## Bug Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file contains a corrected version. This revised code first ensures that the 'age' field is numeric. It includes better error handling and more robust aggregation stages to accurately calculate average ages and counts per city.
